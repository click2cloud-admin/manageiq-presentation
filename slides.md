In this introduction we should very quicly explain what is oVirt and how
other systems can be integrated using the API.

# What is oVirt?

- A virtualization platform.

- Manages virtual machines, storage and networks.

- Easy to use web interface, for humans.

- Comprehensive REST API, for other systems.

- Integrated with ManageIQ as a infrastructure provider, via the REST
  API.

Worth also mentioning that it is Open Source, and based on KVM and
Linux.
